Some have described this five foot tall brunette as "fierce and dramatic." She agrees wholeheartedly.

Amanda Brown is a 17-year-old writer and the founder of SKGfun, an e-magazine and blog written by girls, for girls. When not pasted in front of a computer screen, Amanda feels most at home dancing in the rain, reading Jane Austen movies, and playing soccer with her brothers. She has also written poetry and composed two original pieces for the piano.

Amanda does not like egotistical guys, flirtatious girls and books with poor plots. She is renowned for her terrible sense of direction, but also loyalty and compassion towards those she loves.

"Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you." 1 Samuel 12:24
